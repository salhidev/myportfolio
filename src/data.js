Ayoub was a Student Web and Mobile Developer with responsibilities including but not limited to developing iOS and Android mobile apps as well as web applications. In this position, he reported to me and worked with two to three other student developers at any given time. I was the Lead Architect for Enterprise Web Development at Georgia Southern during Ayoub’s employment. Ayoub was an intelligent and skillful employee that I thoroughly enjoyed supervising. He was very se lf motivated and a quick learner who accomplished all the tasks that were assigned to him. If I gave him a project that involved technology that was new to him, he always had a great attitude and was able to use his research skills and solid work ethic to quickly learn new skills and deliver the project on time. From my perspective, it was obvious that other student employees liked Ayoub as well. He was always helpful to other employees that needed his assistance and he was also a good listener if he needed to receive help from others. If I ever have the opportunity to work with Ayoub again, I would not hesitate. He is a very bright individual and I’m sure the future holds great things for him. If you would like additional information about Ayoub, you can reach me at dusty.edenfield@oit.gatech.edu or call 404-385-4729. Sincerely",

He was employed as a student developer in the Enterprise Technology Solutions (formerly Enterprise Application Services) department of Information Technology Services at Georgia Southern University from October 2014 through December 2015. \n I supervised Ayoub in his role as student developer for a short period from October — December 2015 and in that time was impressed with his self-motivation, technical skills and enthusiasm for learning new technologies. Ayoub is responsible, polite and has a great attitude; he follows through on what he says he’ll do and meets deadlines. \n In his role with our department, Ayoub developed new web and mobile applications and provided troubleshooting and other assistance on existing sites and applications, demonstrating his knowledge of HTML5/CSS, PHP, MySQL, scripting and API programming. \n One of Ayoub’s strongest contributions to our department was in the development of mobile beacon technology. Ayoub presented his work on the mobile beacon project, including a functional demonstration of the technology, to key leadership at the University which enabled us to get the buy-in we needed to move forward with using the new technology on campus. \n If you would like to discuss anything further, please feel free to contact me at rhickey @georgiasouthern.edu. \n Sincerely,",
